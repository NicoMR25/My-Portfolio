                <p>Back in 2022 when my wife and me<br/>

        <p>I love going to concerts, especially those featuring big Rock and Metal bands. There is something<br/>
            electrifying about the pulsating energy of a live performance, especially when it comes to the <br/>
            Rock and Metal bands. Each concert is an opportunity for me to lose myself into the music and <br/>
            become one with the rhythm of the crowd.

                <p>One of those days when me and my wife <br/>
                    sit down to jam a bit

            Playing the guitar is the kind of thing that transports me to a different world, especially when<br/> 
            I am playing with my friends in our band in front of an audience. While I think a description<br/>
            for my portfolio regarding my hobbie for playing guitar I realised that the reason for me to like<br/> 
            so much Rock and Metal is because I picture myself playing those amazing songs with my friends<br/>
            and even with my wife, which by the way is an amazing singer.

        <p>
            I really enjoy reading about history, police thrillers, adventure, philosophy and also manga.<br/>
            I have to be honest, Police thrillers are the ones I like the most and specially if they are mixed<br/>
            with some historical events or if they are divided in different sections so the book starts playing<br/>
            with the time and starts going back to the past then to the future, just like in The Truth about the<br/>
            Harry Quebert Affair.

            Eating and travelling, especially with my wife, are among my greatest joys. I love trying different cuisines,
            always along with a good wine. A fun fact about my wife and me is that we always rate the food in the restaurants
            and if in average between food, service and the place everuthing combined is more than 8 we will surely come back.
